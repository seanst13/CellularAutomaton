# Cellular Automaton
This repository is for the Cellular Automaton Assignment from my Second Year of University. Written in C++, the code is incredibly inefficient and old due to my lack of common programming conventions at the time of originally writing the source code. This is being  primarily used as an archive to hold the assignment and to highlight how I've improved.  

Future revisions and rewrites to this assignment will be made in a supsequent folder. Primarily so comparisons between my terrible programming abilities and now can be compared.
