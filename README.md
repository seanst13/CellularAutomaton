# Cellular Automaton
This repository is for the Cellular Automaton Assignment form my Second Year of University. Written in C++, the code is incredibly inefficient and old due to my lack of common programming conventions at the time of originally writing the source code. This is being used as an archive to hold the assignment. 

Future revisions and rewrites to this assignment will be made in a supsequent folder. Primarily so comparisons between my terrible programming abilities and now can be compared.
